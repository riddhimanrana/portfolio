***Warning: This is an old writeup from 5th grade, so it might be cheesy and not very well written but it was still really fun and something I was into back then.***

## Introduction

Apple is Apple. Apple is the maker of a watch, a phone, a desktop, a laptop, a tablet, a HomePod whatever. But there is one thing that all of these 10+ different products have on their website whether it be the cheapest iPhone SE or it be the iPhone 12 Pro Max or the 2020 MacBook Air at $999. They are all a minimalistic design.
This seems familiar right, when the iPhone 8 released, it removed the headphone jack for a wireless AirPod industry just for the sake of more sales of AirPods and more talking on the internet and more advertisements about Samsung saying you need dongles for charging and listening to your plugged in headphone. But these mistakes sometimes are intentional. They know that secretly every company will change after Apple. And the next year Samsung released their phone without a headphone port and removed their ad about the hilarious change. And now, I think that 80% of the world uses wireless headphones. So then Apple sparked and took another industry. How many times have you heard of Pixel Buds or Galaxy Buds? Same with the iPad. People thought it was trash but then now do you know of anything else other than crappy fire tablets or well some Samsung tablets. Same with the Watch, the Apple Watch is probably 75% of what you hear, 20% Fitbit, and occasionally a 5% Samsung Watch. There are many more instances like the Magic Keyboard and the iPad Air Gen 4 and iPad Pro 2020 but I am saying all this because it had one thing that the people on stage say when they announce their products.

## The Grand Rules Apple Lives On

They would say, “The purpose of the iPad is to stop having you open up your notebooks a lot of times”…….”The purpose of the iPhone is to give you everything basic tasks and control everything at once”…….”The purpose of the iWatch is to stop having you look at your phone for the time and fitness”……and you could go say HomePod is stop using your phone, notebook stop using your Mac Pro and use a Mac mini or MacBook and many more.
So at last, how so much success. Well the real key is the key to understanding how to understand competition. They unlike Samsung, Google, and others compete with themselves. The M1 chip means oh I’m using a Mac Pro or iMac, lets use a smaller device. Mac mini vs MacBook Pro, MacBook Pro vs MacBook Air, MacBook Air vs iPad, iPads(for all the version) vs iPhones, iPhones vs iWatch. On top of that is their biggest advantage, control over everything, from the chip, the display, regular hardware, and software. This means they are competing with themselves unlike Google or Samsung who boast about unlimited storage or a no need for dual camera setup something like that. However, Apple may mildly start shifting in that direction as shown in the end of the Apple November 10th M1 chip event where the PC was showing it was fast but it needed power immediately after that or comparing 98% faster than windows laptops. This is the way they dominate the market. If they compare themselves to others they overthink the features and say oh, they included 5g, I need that…..100* zoom..slim design…8k video footage…and thousands more…something like google does with unlimited storage. This is how Apple sparks another market. When you spark a new market you have the advantage of 1 year before the others release a new brand. This is why of all the events that happen, Apple release their flagships of 2020 smartphones near the end in October. Here are the Grand Rules of Apple:

1. Privacy is key. Users must be allowed to choose whatever they want except for apps that will collide their system

2. Keep complete control over what happens in the phone. When data is taken at the most rare case, encrypt it with a random name like Johny AppleSeed, choose location as imprecise, and a random place such as California to the Middle of the Pacific Ocean, and under a total secure enclave in the chip. Design wise, control over regular hardware, software and chipset.

3. Never release anything copied from someone else and don’t tell false information. It will only lose your users as an untrusted company leaving falling revenues.

4. Keep track of regular ad revenue and stay secretive. When releasing your stuff, don’t tell everything from gHz to how you make it. Tell numbers that the average market will understand….you know that the regular day to day person will not understand what you say and they will go to YouTube to check reviews. When you tubers come and are like “Wow! This is amazing!” Then you win another market as the first completely controlled computer ever made. Samsung may try next year..(unlikely like the iPad) but it wins more people and users

5. Keep whatever you have, the best of the best. Don’t be a diverse company like HP. They sell so many products but its not like any of the products stand out as a great one. Focus on one thing at a time.

6. Dominate markets by being the first….not by killing other companies for just money.

7. Don’t focus on features, this is where you buy small companies. Say for example when they wanted Touch ID they bought Authentic and when they needed Siri they bought Siri.

8. Invent something new every 5 years. Bring a new market to Apple so that your users don’t get bored with you just saying better camera better screen.
