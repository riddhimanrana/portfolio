## Introduction

There's obviously been a lot of hype around Neovim, especially with the rise of plugins like LunarVim and AstroNvim. However, after trying it out, I found that it didn't quite fit my workflow. Here's why I decided to stick with VSCode and Zed instead.

## 1. Learning Curve

Neovim has a steep learning curve, especially if you're not already familiar with Vim's modal editing. While I appreciate the efficiency that modal editing can bring, I found that the time investment required to become proficient in Neovim wasn't worth it for my current needs.

## 2. Plugin Ecosystem

While Neovim has a rich plugin ecosystem, I found that many of the plugins I wanted to use were either not as polished or required more configuration than I was willing to invest. In contrast, VSCode and Zed have a more user-friendly plugin experience, with many high-quality extensions available out of the box.

## 3. Performance
Neovim is known for its performance, but I found that both VSCode and Zed performed adequately for my needs. The speed differences were negligible in my day-to-day tasks, and the additional features offered by these editors outweighed any performance benefits Neovim might have had.
