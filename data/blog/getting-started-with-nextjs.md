# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and many other features without requiring complex configuration.

## Installation

To create a new Next.js application, run one of the following commands:

\`\`\`bash
# Using npx
npx create-next-app@latest my-app

# Using yarn
yarn create next-app my-app

# Using pnpm
pnpm create next-app my-app
\`\`\`

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Files placed in the `pages` directory (or `app` directory in the App Router) automatically become routes based on their file name.

### 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Next.js renders React components on the server before sending them to the client, which improves performance and SEO.

\`\`\`jsx
// Example of a Server Component in the App Router
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Static Site Generation (SSG)

Next.js can generate static HTML pages at build time, which can be served from a CDN for maximum performance.

### 4. API Routes

Next.js allows you to create API endpoints easily by adding files to the `pages/api` directory (or using Route Handlers in the App Router).

\`\`\`jsx
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' });
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework that makes building React applications easier and more efficient. By handling many of the configuration details, Next.js allows developers to focus on building their applications rather than setting up infrastructure.
