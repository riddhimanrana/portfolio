# Understanding USACO Competitions and How to Prepare

The USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) is a prestigious computer programming competition for high school students. In this post, I'll share my experience as a USACO Gold medalist and provide tips for effective preparation.

## USACO Divisions

USACO has four divisions, each representing a different skill level:

1. **Bronze** - The entry-level division focusing on basic programming skills and simple algorithms
2. **Silver** - Introduces more advanced data structures and algorithms
3. **Gold** - Requires sophisticated algorithm knowledge and problem-solving skills
4. **Platinum** - The highest division with complex algorithmic challenges

Participants begin in Bronze and can promote to higher divisions by performing well in contests.

## Key Topics to Master

### Bronze Division
- Basic programming constructs
- Simple data structures (arrays, strings)
- Ad-hoc problem solving
- Complete search (brute force)
- Simulation

### Silver Division
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Binary search
- Graph representation
- Depth-first search (DFS) and Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Prefix sums
- Custom comparators

### Gold Division
- Dynamic programming
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)
- Minimum spanning trees
- Network flow
- Tree algorithms
- Range queries

## Code Example: DFS Implementation

```cpp
void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<bool>& visited, int node) {
    visited[node] = true;
    cout << "Visiting node " << node << endl;
    
    for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            dfs(graph, visited, neighbor);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Number of nodes
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    
    // Add edges
    graph[0].push_back(1);
    graph[0].push_back(2);
    graph[1].push_back(3);
    graph[2].push_back(4);
    
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    dfs(graph, visited, 0);
    
    return 0;
}
