## Hey!

It's me Riddhiman! This is my first blog post, here and it's also kind of a test but basically, this is my first blog post here. I'm going to be talking about my tech stack for this website. I'm using Astro, a new static site generator that I'm really excited about. I'm also using Tailwind CSS for styling and MDX for writing my blog posts. I'm also using Vercel for hosting and GitHub for version control. I'm really excited to be using Astro and I'm looking forward to learning more about it. I'm also looking forward to writing more blog posts and learning in public. I'm really excited about this new website and I'm looking forward to sharing more about it in the future.

### USACO

I'm a *passionate* `competitive` programmer, so I'm also going to be writing about my journey in competitive programming and my experience with USACO. I'm really excited to be sharing more about that in the future. I'm also looking forward to learning more about Astro and writing more blog posts. I'm really excited about this new website and I'm looking forward to sharing more about it in the future.
